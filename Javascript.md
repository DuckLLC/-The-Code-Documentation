Using JavaScript is helpful in many ways

So here is my Documentation on it

## Variables

To use variables you must declare them like this:

```js
Var x = _ ;
```
But you can also change them while the code is running like this:

```js
x = "Yes" ;
```

This can help in some codes.

## Math and Variables

You can also use math with variables. Even though math is hard, you can make it easyer! Like:

```js
Var money = 0 ;
Var tax = .5 ;
Var on = true ;

while(on == true){
  money = money + 1 * tax
}
```

You can use all of the operations with this code with: +, -, /, *.
